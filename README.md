# Forewords

First of all, thanks for visiting my page.

I have never thought of having a something on Github like this, until the day when I started using Apache Flink: I found a bugs, got encouraged by one of the main contributor of Flink to scratch my own itch. That's what led to my first Pull-Request to an open source project.

Later, when talking to a recruiter, she asked me whether I have my own page. Yes, I have ^_^ some boring pieces of code. But, I know that I have to add something more to that.

Here are something to start with:
 - [A comparison between Spark Structured Streaming and Flink](https://github.com/lvhuyen/Notes/blob/master/Spark_vs_Flink.md)
 - [Large number of small files in S3](https://github.com/lvhuyen/Notes/blob/master/StreamingSourceWithALargeNumberOfFiles.md) - a problem I faced with in one of my streaming project
